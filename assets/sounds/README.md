# Sound Assets

## Detection Sound

The app uses a detection sound effect when a gesture is successfully detected.

### Adding the Sound File

1. Place an MP3 file named `detection.mp3` in this directory (`assets/sounds/`)
2. The sound should be short (100-300ms) for best user experience
3. Recommended: A simple beep or click sound

### Note

If the sound file is missing, the app will continue to work normally - sound effects are optional.
The app will log a warning in debug mode but won't crash.
